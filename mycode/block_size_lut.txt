# Block size lookup table for unfixed partitioning
# Format per line: zone:start-end:bx,by,bz
# - zone: integer zone id starting from 0
# - start-end: Chebyshev distance interval (inclusive)
# - bx,by,bz: block sizes for that zone/interval
# Lines starting with # are comments and ignored.
# Example: zone 0 covers distances 0-63 with block size 10x10x6
